```bash
cd App-Python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Run Locally

To run the project locally on your machine:

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:
```bash
cd App-Python
```

2. **Start the application**:
```bash
python app.py
```
This will make the application available at http://localhost:5000

## Build and Run with Docker

1. Build the Docker image: Make sure you are in the project directory and then run:
```bash
docker build -t app-python .
```

2. Run the container: Once the image is built, you can run the container:
```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 app-python
```
This will make the application available at http://localhost:5000

## Docker Hub

The image for this project is also available on Docker Hub, allowing you to run it without needing to build it locally. You can get it by running:

```bash
docker pull jdhidalgo673/app-python:latest
```

```bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 jdhidalgo673/app-python:latest
```
This will make the application available at http://localhost:5000
